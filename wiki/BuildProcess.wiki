#summary How to build Pause Quafé
= What about Gradle =

Pause Quafé is built with [http://www.gradle.org/ Gradle]. [http://www.gradle.org/ Gradle] is an enterprise-grade build system which provides: 

  * A very flexible general purpose build tool like Ant.
  * Switchable, build-by-convention frameworks a la Maven, for Java, Groovy and Scala projects. But we never lock you in! 
  * Groovy build scripts.
  * Powerful support for multi-project builds.
  * Powerful dependency management (based on Apache Ivy).
  * Full support for your existing Maven or Ivy repository infrastructure.
  * Support for transitive dependency management without the need for remote repositories and pom.xml or ivy.xml files (optional). 
  * Ant tasks and builds as first class citizens.

= Build Process =

Gradle runs a single script to build all distributions (Windows, MacOSX & Linux)

Just type :
{{{
gradle clean windowsDistrib macosxDistrib linuxDistrib
}}}
at the root of the project to run the build. You can omit one or several `xxxDistrib` tasks if you want to. The `clean` task deletes the `build` directory before building.



All generated artifacts will be in :
{{{
build/distributions/
}}}
