Tired of having to install wine or similar to have a real character monitoring tool on mac or Linux? 

Well this is for you...

A few months ago, one of my friends and me decided to code a Java clone of EVEMon.

= Details =

We use QT for the GUI of the program. It will be integrated with the installation packages once we have a working version.
