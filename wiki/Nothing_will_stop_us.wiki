A few months ago, one of my friends and me decided to code a Java clone of EVEMon. 
We don't intend to make something as complex as EVEMon but be sure that the crucial features will be well covered.

We use Qt for the GUI of the program. It will be integrated with the installation packages once we have a working version.
