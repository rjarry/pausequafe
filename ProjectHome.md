Tired of having to install wine or similar to have a real character monitoring tool on mac or Linux?

A few months ago, one of my friends and I decided to code a Java clone of EVEMon.
We don't intend to make something as complex as EVEMon but be sure that the crucial features will be well covered.

# Details #

We use Qt for the GUI of the program. It will be integrated with the installation packages once we have a working version.
